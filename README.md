This project was created in my internship at company SAILET. I created this app with react-native. In this app I created:
=> News list screen using endpoint api with FlatList 
=> Request screen using FlatList, FlatList include username, and his requests and links to Whatsapp, phone number and Telegram.
=> Complains screen , user can send their complains with filling form to our endpoint.
=> AddRequest screen, user can send requests to our endpoint apis by filling form.
=> About page, It's little information about project.
